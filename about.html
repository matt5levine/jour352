<p>
  Hello! I am Matt Levine, a senior broadcast journalism major at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism.
</p>
<p>
  I am a play-by-play broadcaster, with experience in baseball, basketball, football, soccer, softball, field hockey, lacrosse, volleyball and wrestling.
</p>
<p>
  I have had internship experience outside of college, as well as experience at Maryland. I spent this past summer as a play-by-play broadcaster for the Falmouth Commodores in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Additionally, I have interned for the Montgomery County Sports Hall of Fame and I currently intern for the Maryland Athletics Media Relations Department.
</p>
<p>
  At Maryland, I have worked for WMUC Sports Radio, Maryland's student-run radio station, the Maryland Baseball Network and the Big Ten Network+. In addition to my work as a play-by-play broadcaster, I am currently the Station Director for WMUC Sports Radio and the Director of Broadcasting and Media for the Maryland Baseball Network.
